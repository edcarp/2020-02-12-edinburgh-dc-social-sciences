# Feedback (R intro) 19.2.2020

numbers: fully booked (32 places); 1-2 people missing, 1 left during break

material: used 3h30min to get through DCSS materials to 'Factors'

issues: there were some installation hiccups on linux (needed to install curl, openssl etc w apt-get install)

keep:
+ great+handy session to know R
+ it was very intersting and useful sessions. Thank you very much!
+ very knowledgeable instructor. gives good explanations
+ It was very helpful to understand R and perform some command.
+ Thanks it was very useful!
+ Becomes clear how we can disaggregate information from a large complex spreadsheet of data
+ Really knowlegeable + helpful (?)
+ Really Good material. online resources excellent!
+ keeps good pace
+ Excellent. perfect pacing. very clear.
+ good pace
+ sticky note system

to improve:
- a little overwhelming for someone who has never been exposed to R and programming before (on a green sticky)
- two break instead of one
- better ventilation in the room
- was not clear what the outcome we are trying to achieve before start running through functions
- this is really hard :/ as a _total_ beginner; I couldn't follow a lot
- delivery of workshop might be missing some of the reasons of why they work
- also, instructor seems very knowledgeable but sounds a bit insecure
- it was not that clear how to open a dataset
