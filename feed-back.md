# Feedback (R data analysis and visualisation) 26.2.2020

 R data analysis and visualisation (13:00-16:30)

 numbers: 32 places (fully booked), ca 26 on the day, 1-2 participants left early;
          had 6 helpers which is a very good ratio 
 
 issues: surprisingly more trouble with downloading the data again (took ca 10min rather than 1min), 
         then also a bit with write_csv
 
 material: got through the lesson, but had to drop spread/gather and serveral exercises, 
           in the end rushed through facets and saving the plot
 
 issues with downloading csv (at the start, ca 10m in instread of 1min) and also using write_csv alter
 helper-participant ratio ca 1 to 4 (good), when all were speaking almost too loud

 keep:
 + good exercises 
 + learning extra things about ggplot I hadn't used
 + really great session thanks so much. love the helpers!
 + clear and informative as ? ? thanks   (two words unclear) 
 + liked the explanation on GGplot
 + that was great, last weeks session helped so much with this weeks + I feel like I'm getting somewhere!
 + thank you for the course! I think it was a good system and don't have any suggestions!
 + Great example + exercise
 + very informative; definitely more useful to attempt to work through course resources before session
 + Many demonstrators to help around: Good job! helpful staff.
 + I do enjoy this workshop and the way you taught. I learned a lot! thanks! :p

 improve:
 - signpost when we are getting something essential, and when we are getting something optional
 - having a sort of workshop handout with questions to work through if you are working through a bit faster,
   rather than just one the shared bit
 - sometimes can go fast
 - put the master code on the sharing doc at ehnd of class pls
 - A lot of chatter when we were going through due to helpers. Quite distracting.
 - Felt the workshop took longer to start and spendt too long on 'recap' 'troubleshooting' at beginning.


# Feedback (R intro) 19.2.2020

numbers: fully booked (32 places); 1-2 people missing, 1 left during break

material: used 3h30min to get through DCSS materials to 'Factors'

issues: there were some installation hiccups on linux (needed to install curl, openssl etc w apt-get install)

keep:
+ great+handy session to know R
+ it was very intersting and useful sessions. Thank you very much!
+ very knowledgeable instructor. gives good explanations
+ It was very helpful to understand R and perform some command.
+ Thanks it was very useful!
+ Becomes clear how we can disaggregate information from a large complex spreadsheet of data
+ Really knowlegeable + helpful (?)
+ Really Good material. online resources excellent!
+ keeps good pace
+ Excellent. perfect pacing. very clear.
+ good pace
+ sticky note system

to improve:
- a little overwhelming for someone who has never been exposed to R and programming before (on a green sticky)
- two break instead of one
- better ventilation in the room
- was not clear what the outcome we are trying to achieve before start running through functions
- this is really hard :/ as a _total_ beginner; I couldn't follow a lot
- delivery of workshop might be missing some of the reasons of why they work
- also, instructor seems very knowledgeable but sounds a bit insecure
- it was not that clear how to open a dataset

# Feebback (Spreadsheets and OpenRefine) 12.2.2020

NB: 4 participants only

keep:
 + great explanation of useful software
